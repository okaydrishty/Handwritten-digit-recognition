# Handwritten-digit-recognition
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in computer vision and machine learning. It involves classifying images of handwritten digits (0-9) into their respective categories. This problem is widely solved using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
